# Introduction
This repo contains the exploratory data analysis and recommendation system for the Kaggle Challenge [WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge)

# Prerequisits / Dependencies
The environment.yml contains all the necessary information about the setup(packages, python version, etc) of my conda envrionment. You can even use this yml to quickly create a conda environment (see conda documentation for details). Note that some of the packages may depend on me using a windows system. However, the analysis also worked on my ubuntu 64-bit.
